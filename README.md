Facial recognition technology is widely used in security, authentication, and personalized services. This
project compares three techniques—Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients
(HoG), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)—for classifying facial images into predefined categories.
We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in terms of accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) is a renowned database of face photographs designed for studying
unconstrained face recognition. Developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst,
it consists of 13,233 images of 5,749 individuals, sourced from the web and processed using the Viola
Jones face detector.

For the face identification task, we have explored three distinct feature extraction techniques—Local
Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) features.

After conducting comprehensive experiments, we presented our findings, highlighting the best accuracy
achieved for each feature extraction technique. We observed that the ANN model on HoG features
yielded the highest accuracy among all techniques tested.
